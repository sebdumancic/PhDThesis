	title = {Meta-Interpretive Learning of Higher-Order Dyadic Datalog:  Predicate Invention revisited},
	conference = {International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence},
	year = {2013},
	keywords = {Mate-interpretation Learning Logic},
	abstract = {In recent years Predicate Invention has been under-explored within Inductive Logic Programming due to difficulties in formulating efficient search mechanisms. However, a recent paper demonstrated that both predicate invention and the learning of recursion can be efficiently implemented for regular and context-free grammars, by way of abduction with respect to a meta-interpreter. New predicate symbols are introduced as constants representing existentially quantified higher-order variables. In this paper we generalise the approach of Meta-Interpretive Learning (MIL) to that of learning higher-order dyadic datalog programs. We show that with an infinite signature the higher-order dyadic datalog class H22 has universal Turing expressivity though H22 is decidable given a finite signature. Additionally we show that Knuth-Bendix ordering of the hypothesis space together with logarithmic clause bounding allows our Dyadic MIL implementation MetagolD to PAC-learn minimal cardinailty H22 definitions. This result is consistent with our experiments which indicate that MetagolD efficiently learns compact H22 definitions involving predicate invention for robotic strategies and higher-order concepts in the NELL language learning domain.},

abstract="Two contributions are sketched. A first contribution shows that a special case of relational learning can be transformed into attribute-value learning. However, it is much more tractable to stick to the relational representation than to apply the sketched transformation. This provides a sound theoretical justification for inductive logic programming. In a second contribution, we show how existing attribute-value learning techniques and systems can be upgraded towards inductive logic programming using the `Leuven' methodology and illustrate it using the Claudien, Tilde, ICL, Warmr, TIC, MacCent and RRL systems.",
